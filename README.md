Web - Project 2 (Solo version)  
Because, love too can be industrialized

### **Description**

This project is about creating a dating website. 

## **Objective**

Create an app allowing two potential lovers to meet,
from the registration to the final encounter. A user will then be able to register, connect, fill his/her profile, search and look into
the profile of other users, like them and chat with those that “liked” back.  
  
For this project any language is permitted; micro-frameworks and libraries are also permitted. Consider that a “micro-framework” has a router, and eventually templating,
but no ORM, validators or User Accounts Manager. PHP, Rust, Mongoose, Angular, C++, etc are forbidden
** Due to this being the Solo version of a curriculum Group project, these contraints were overlooked in order to create a more industry relevant & secure app while learning JS. The valid group project (WIP / still to be submitted) can be found at https://github.com/mchocho/Matcha2.0 **

In this project:
- Node
- Express for Node

- Passport
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- AWS S3 Storage
